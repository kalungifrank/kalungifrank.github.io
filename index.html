            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am passionate about technology and I believe it has the ability to revolutionalize the future of humanity. I am self taught programmer with over 10 years experience in designing web, mobile and desktop software. I particularly drawn to the application of programming to biological science which accelerates the production of drugs, vaccines, disease-resistant crops and many other biotech products. By using technology, I hope to contribute to Africa's developing biotechnology industry through development of bioinformatics software/pipelines for drug design and genome engineering.
